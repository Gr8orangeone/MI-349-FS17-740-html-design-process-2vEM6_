            Bounce Me To The Moon is the worlds foremost space program.
            Specializing in spring coil and mesh based propulsion we plan to use our patented system based on the
            double bounce phenomenon to send a man to the moon.

        <pre>
            Bounce Me To The Moon Is an open source project based upon coil spring propulsion.
            Because springs are not as dangerous as rocket fuel and jet engines this system is not only cheaper but
            also much more practical for the common man.
            Using the Double Bounce Phenomenon we plan to achieve the first ever human powered moon landing.
            with the help of investors we plan to build the worlds largest Hybrid Manual Coil Spring Propulsion
            system or "Trampoline" in layman's terms.
